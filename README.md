## About

An app where music reviews are curated by the opinions of those who matter most: the fans themselves. 
Users can log in with existing Spotify or Apple Music accounts, and choose between upcoming albums. 
A countdown timer will be displayed until the album drops. When it does, all users can listen at the exact same time, 
and give feedback. Live comments and tags will be displayed, and users can press on them to upvote them.
